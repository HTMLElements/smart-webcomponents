    <h1>Server-Side CRUD operations</h1>
    When a new card is added, removed or updated a request with CRUD data
    object is made via 'virtualDataSource' on the Server-Side Datasource. The
    server uses the SQL query sent by the Server-Side Datasource to get the
    records. The type of query is stored in the request's action property.
    <br />
    <br />This example uses a demo server with AlaSQL that generates SQL to show
    how a real server might use the requests sent by the CardView. The Server-Side
    CardView usage does not have any restrictions on the server-side technologies
    used.
