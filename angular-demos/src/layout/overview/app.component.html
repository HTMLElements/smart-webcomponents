            <textarea class="input">The massive Cathedral of Santa Maria Nascente, which the Milanese call
                just "Il Duomo" is among the world's largest (it holds up to 40,000 people)
                and most magnificent churches, the ultimate example of the Flamboyant Gothic
                style. It was begun in the 14th century, but its façade was not completed
                until the early 1800s, under Napoleon. The roof is topped by 135 delicately
                carved stone pinnacles and the exterior is decorated with 2,245 marble
                statues. The dim interior, in striking contrast to the brilliant and richly
                patterned exterior, makes a powerful impression with its 52 gigantic pillars.
                The stained-glass windows in the nave (mostly 15th-16th centuries) are
                the largest in the world; the earliest of them are in the south aisle.
                Highlights include the seven-branched bronze candelabrum by Nicholas of
                Verdun (c. 1200) in the north transept, the 16th-century tomb of Gian Giacomo
                Medici, and the jeweled gold reliquary of San Carlo Borromeo in the octagonal
                Borromeo Chapel leading off the crypt. Behind the high altar, the choir
                has deeply carved panels, and misericords under the seats. In the south
                sacristy is the treasury with gold and silver work dating from the fourth
                to the 17th century. A walk on the roof of the cathedral is an impressive
                experience, offering views across the city and extending on clear days
                to the snow-covered Alps. (An elevator ascends all but the last 73 steps
                to the platform of the dome). At the front of the Duomo, near the central
                doorway, you can descend under Piazza del Duomo into the foundations of
                the Basilica di Santa Tecla (fourth-fifth and seventh century) and the
                fourth-century baptistery, Battistero di San Giovanni alle Fonti, which
                were discovered during the construction of the Milan Metro system.</textarea>

            <p>Milan, a metropolis in Italy's northern Lombardy region, is a global capital
