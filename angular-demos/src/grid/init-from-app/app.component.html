<div class="demo-description">Smart's App class defines the bindings between View and Data. When a Smart
    App instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its data object
    to Smart’s reactivity system. When the values of those properties change,
    the view will “react”, updating to match the new values. The "render" method
    of the instance defines the DOM within the app's root element.</div>
