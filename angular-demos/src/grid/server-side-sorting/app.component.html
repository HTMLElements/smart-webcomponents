<div class="demo-description">
     <h1>Server-Side Sorting</h1>
    When a data sort is applied in the datagrid a request with Sorting data
    object is made via 'virtualDataSource' on the Server-Side Datasource. The
    server uses the SQL query sent by the Server-Side Datasource to sort the
    rows.
   This example uses a demo server with AlaSQL that generates SQL to show
    how a real server might use the requests sent by the Datagrid. The Server-Side
    Datagrid usage does not have any restrictions on the server-side technologies
    used.
