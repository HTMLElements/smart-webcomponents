    	<h1>Server-side Grouping</h1>Datagrid in this example is with Grouping feature turned-on. That is achieved
    by setting the dataSource's 'groupBy' property. When a row is expanded
    the datagrid sends a request with the expanded row data object on the Server-Side
    Datasource. The server uses the SQL query sent by the Server-Side Datasource
    and returns the requested sub-rows collection. This example uses a demo
    server with AlaSQL that generates SQL to show how a real server might use
    the requests sent by the Datagrid. The Server-Side Datagrid usage does
    not have any restrictions on the server-side technologies used.</div>
