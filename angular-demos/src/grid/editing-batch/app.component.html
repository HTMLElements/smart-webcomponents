    <h1>Batch Editing in Data Grid</h1>
    <p>The data grid allows you to edit and update multiple grid rows on the
        client side and send them with a single server request. To enable the Grid's
        batch editing, the 'editing.batch' property should be set to 'true' The
        'editing.commandBar' setting allows you to display a toolbar or statusbar
        with tools for saving and reverting the edit made by the users. This is
        done by setting 'editing.commandBar.visible' to 'true'.</p>
