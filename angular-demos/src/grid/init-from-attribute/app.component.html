    	<h1>Grid Init From Attribute</h1>
    <p>The Grid in this example is created from a DIV tag with attribute 'smartGrid'
        when the page is loaded. That approach allows us to easily create the component
        from a DIV tag on demand to speed up the initial page load.</p>

<div is="smartGrid" id="grid"></div>
