<div class="demo-description">This page shows how to customize the Sort Icons and also how to always
    show a sort icon which indicates that a datagrid column is sortable. This
    is achieved by using the "autoShowColumnSortButton" property. The column's
    "allowSort" property determines whether a column is sortable.</div>
