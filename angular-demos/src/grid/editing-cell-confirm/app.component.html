    <h1>Grid Cells Editing Confirm</h1>
    We implement the 'onCellUpdate' Grid function. When a cell value is edited,
    'onCellUpdate' is called. That callback can be used for Client-Server validation
    of the Cell Editing. The function is implemented for the 'Quantity' column
    and we simulate Ajax call to a Web Server by using setTimeout and confirm
    the changes by calling the 4th argument of 'onCellUpdate', which is a function.
    When we call it with 'true', changes are confirmed. Otherwise, they are
    canceled. In this example, when the 'Quantity' is > 10, changes are confirmed.
