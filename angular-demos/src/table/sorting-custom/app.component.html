<div class="demo-description">This demo shows how to implement a custom sorting function in smart-table.
    In the example below, when sorting by the second column ("Name"), rows
    are sorted based on the localized values of cells, not based on the underlying
    data.</div>
<smart-table #table id="table" [dataSource]="dataSource" [sortMode]="sortMode" [sort]="sort" [columns]="columns">
</smart-table>
