<div class="demo-description"> <b>nonworkingDays</b> colored in gray determine which days of the week
    are nonworking. Nonwokring days are ignored. This means that dropping a
    task in a nonworking day will add/remove slack time to it in order to recalculate
    the start/end date to a working date. Weekends are always colored in light
    blue.</div>
