<div class="demo-description">Our grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout
    content. It is built with Grid Layout and is fully responsive. The columns
    are defined with "col-sm-4" class for small devices and when the size reaches
    the breakpoint, the columns are stacked.</div>
